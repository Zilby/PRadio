# PRadio
The p definitely doesn't stand for sketchy content - GGJ 2018

# Setup
- Download Unity 2018 here if you haven't already: https://store.unity.com/download?ref=personal
- If you're on windows and don't have GitBash, download this here: https://git-scm.com/download/win
- Link your computer to your github account via SSH or HTML if you haven't already. You can learn how to do that here: https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/#platform-windows (I recommend setting up via SSH since it's a bit easier and is more secure). 
- Once all of that is set up, clone this repository (SSH link: git@github.com:Zilby/PRadio.git, HTML link: https://github.com/Zilby/PRadio.git). You can do this by pasting `git clone _insert_link_here_` into either GitBash (you can paste using `shift + insert`) or the terminal if you're on mac.
